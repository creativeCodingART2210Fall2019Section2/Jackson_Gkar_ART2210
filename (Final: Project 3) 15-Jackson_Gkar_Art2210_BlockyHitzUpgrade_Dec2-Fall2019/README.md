My goal was to upgrade my current game called BlockyHitz. It was hard because I attempted various ways to load images, tried outside sources, and all. It just wasn’t working out for me. I tried to add a batman figure background to give my game some suspense and to make it seem like a game you will find on y8.com games. I wanted to make the snake eat a piece of meat every time it ate something. But I was focusing on attempting to upload a background. I tried to create a vector for the food, I thought I got the location down correctly. My function key pressed worked as planned. I tried to print text to say like game over, or End Game, but it popped up before and never emerge back again. I made sure I had the resize canvas at the bottom of my sketch. I created a basic background color to contrast it a bit. I used p5.sound.min.js, p5.dom.min.js, and p5.min.js just like we did in class exercises. I created a sperate file for my snake in a sperate js file and it worked successfully. I used a constructor of the snake body and used the class system we discussed in class. I updated the body of the blocks, and also make the body grow every time it eats. This screen shakes supposed to give off a movement effect (me personally). It’s a peer reflect game that allows you to work out your hand-and-eye coordination speed and it keep going. So, if you playing with someone, the person can keep track of your time and attempt to out beat your time. I utilize the false option to end the game so that if you’re out of bounds, you lose or eat yourself you lose. Simple game, I hope you enjoy it.

Thanks,
